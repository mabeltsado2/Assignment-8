              Hello. I am Mabel Tsado and I am studying HCI at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Before starting my masters, I received my bachelors of science in Business Administration at CMU with concentrations in Business Technology and Analytics along with a minor imn Biomedical Engineering.

              <br>
              I am interested in the intersection between business and technology and how to use both to improve the quality of life for different groups of people. I would be interested in working in the service and product design roles in order to bring together my business and HCI backgrounds.
